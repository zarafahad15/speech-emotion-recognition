 Speech Emotion Recognition Using Deep Learning (LSTM Model)
🧾 Overview

This project focuses on Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) — the task of identifying human emotions from voice recordings using Machine Learning and Deep Learning techniques.
It applies audio signal processing (MFCC, Chroma, Mel Spectrogram, and Spectral Contrast) and a Bidirectional LSTM neural network to classify emotions such as happy, sad, angry, neutral, and more.

The model is trained using open-source datasets like RAVDESS, TESS, or EMO-DB, achieving high accuracy on real-world audio data.

🧠 Project Motivation

Human emotion plays a key role in communication, and automating its detection enables smarter systems like:
	•	Virtual assistants (Alexa, Siri, Google Assistant)
	•	Customer support analytics
	•	Mental health monitoring
	•	Human-computer interaction (HCI) tools

This project demonstrates how deep learning can enhance emotional intelligence in AI systems.

⸻

🎯 Objectives
	•	Extract meaningful audio features (MFCC, Chroma, Mel, Spectral Contrast).
	•	Build a Bidirectional LSTM model to classify emotions.
	•	Visualize performance metrics (confusion matrix, accuracy/loss graphs).
	•	Deploy a prediction script to classify new voice samples in real time.

🧰 How It Works

🪄 Step 1: Feature Extraction

Each audio file is processed to extract:
	•	MFCC (Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients) — captures tone and frequency.
	•	Chroma Features — represents the 12 pitch classes.
	•	Mel Spectrogram — energy distribution across frequencies.
	•	Spectral Contrast — differentiates between peaks and valleys.

These are stacked into a 2D feature array per file (shape: time_steps × features).

⚙ Step 2: Model Architecture

Layer Type	Details
Masking	Ignore padded zeros
Bidirectional LSTM	128 units (return sequences)
Dropout	0.3
Bidirectional LSTM	64 units
Dense	64 ReLU
Dropout	0.3
Output	Softmax activation for emotion classes

The model is compiled with:

loss='categorical_crossentropy'
optimizer='adam'
metrics=['accuracy']


⸻

🏋‍♀ Training the Model

To train:

python train.py

This script will:
	•	Load and preprocess data
	•	Extract audio features
	•	Split into training/testing sets
	•	Train the LSTM model
	•	Save the model under /models/ser_lstm_model.h5

You’ll see real-time training logs with accuracy and loss.

⸻

🔊 Predicting Emotions

Once trained, test a new audio file:

python predict.py

Example output:

Predicted Emotion: happy (Confidence: 0.91)


⸻

📊 Model Evaluation

After training, the script displays:
	•	✅ Classification Report
	•	📉 Accuracy/Loss Plot
	•	🔷 Confusion Matrix Visualization

These help assess which emotions the model recognizes best.
